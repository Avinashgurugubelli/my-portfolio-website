# ðŸ“˜ Class Diagram in Object-Oriented Design

## ðŸ§± What is a Class Diagram?

A **Class Diagram** is the backbone of object-oriented modeling. It represents the **static structure** of a system by showing:

- **Classes**
- **Attributes**
- **Methods**
- **Relationships** (associations, inheritance, etc.)

It models how different **entities** (like people, objects, and data) relate to one another.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of Class Diagrams

Class diagrams are used for:

- âœ… Analyzing and designing the **static view** of an application  
- âœ… Describing the **responsibilities** of a system  
- âœ… Providing a base for **component and deployment diagrams**  
- âœ… Supporting **forward and reverse engineering**
