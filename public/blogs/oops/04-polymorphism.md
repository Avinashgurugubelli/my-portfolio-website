## üìñ What is Polymorphism?

**Polymorphism** (Greek: *"many forms"*) allows a single interface or method to represent different underlying forms (data types or behaviors).

It enables:
- Code reuse and flexibility
- Clean separation between what code does and how it does it

## ‚ôüÔ∏è Real-World Analogy ‚Äì Chess Game

In a chess game, all pieces respond to the `move()` command but behave differently:

- `Bishop` moves diagonally
- `Knight` moves in an L-shape
- `Rook` moves in straight lines

> Same method `move()`, but different behaviors.

### üí° Java Example ‚Äì Chess

```java
public interface ChessPiece {
    void move();
}

public class Bishop implements ChessPiece {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Moves diagonally");
    }
}

public class Knight implements ChessPiece {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Moves in L-shape");
    }
}

public class Rook implements ChessPiece {
    public void move() {
        System.out.println("Moves in straight lines");
    }
}

public class ChessBoard {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChessPiece bishop = new Bishop();
        ChessPiece knight = new Knight();
        ChessPiece rook = new Rook();

        bishop.move();  // Output: Moves diagonally
        knight.move();  // Output: Moves in L-shape
        rook.move();    // Output: Moves in straight lines
    }
}
```

## üß™ Types of Polymorphism

### ‚è±Ô∏è 1. Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)

- Achieved through **method overriding**
- Behavior is determined **at runtime**
- Requires **inheritance** or **interfaces**

#### ‚úÖ Java Example

```java
public class Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
    }
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Dog barks");
    }
}

public class Cat extends Animal {
    public void speak() {
        System.out.println("Cat meows");
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Animal a1 = new Dog();
        Animal a2 = new Cat();

        a1.speak();  // Output: Dog barks
        a2.speak();  // Output: Cat meows
    }
}
```

---

### üßÆ 2. Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)

- Achieved through **method overloading**
- Method is selected at **compile time**
- Same method name with **different parameter lists**

#### ‚úÖ Java Example

```java
public class Calculator {
    public int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }

    public int add(int a, int b, int c) {
        return a + b + c;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();

        System.out.println(calc.add(2, 3));         // 5
        System.out.println(calc.add(2.5, 4.1));     // 6.6
        System.out.println(calc.add(1, 2, 3));      // 6
    }
}
```

## ‚ú® When to Use Polymorphism

‚úÖ Use polymorphism when:
- You want to program to **interfaces, not implementations**
- You need **extensible**, **pluggable** behavior
- You want to follow **SOLID principles** (e.g. Open/Closed Principle)

---

## üö´ When *Not* to Use Polymorphism

‚ùå 1. There‚Äôs no ‚Äúis-a‚Äù relationship between types

-   Polymorphism (especially inheritance-based) should be used only when one class is a true subtype of another.
Bad example: Bird extends Car just to reuse a startEngine() method.

‚ùå 2. Overriding/overloading adds complexity with little benefit
- If method overloading/overriding introduces confusion or makes the design harder to understand without improving flexibility, avoid it.
This often happens when developers overuse polymorphism to "look smart," leading to fragile, bloated designs.

‚ùå 3. You're trying to reuse a few methods (prefer composition)
- If you're extending a class just to access a couple of utility methods, it's better to use composition (i.e., include the helper class as a field).
Inheritance forces you to take all the parent‚Äôs behavior ‚Äî even the irrelevant parts ‚Äî which can break encapsulation and lead to tight coupling.

| Type                     | Binding Time | Technique           | Inheritance Needed | Example                      |
|--------------------------|--------------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| Runtime Polymorphism     | Runtime      | Method Overriding    | ‚úÖ Yes             | `Dog extends Animal`         |
| Compile-time Polymorphism| Compile Time | Method Overloading   | ‚ùå No              | `add(int, int)` / `add(double, double)` |

## üí¨ Final Thoughts

Polymorphism helps you write:
- More **reusable**
- More **maintainable**
- More **extensible** code
