# SOLID Principles in Object-Oriented Design

## ðŸ“š Prerequisites

Before diving into SOLID principles, it's recommended to have a good understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts such as:

- Classes and Objects
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Interfaces vs Abstract Classes
- Composition vs Inheritance

You can learn or revise these concepts from this detailed guide:

Object-Oriented Design (OOD) is vital for creating **flexible, scalable, maintainable, and reusable** software systems. While OOD provides powerful abstractions, writing truly clean code requires understanding the **SOLID principles**.

These principles, introduced by **Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob)**, form a set of guidelines that help developers avoid common pitfalls and build well-structured, maintainable systems.

## What Is SOLID?

**SOLID** is an acronym for five object-oriented design principles:

1. **S** â€“ Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)  
2. **O** â€“ Open/Closed Principle (OCP)  
3. **L** â€“ Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)  
4. **I** â€“ Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)  
5. **D** â€“ Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
