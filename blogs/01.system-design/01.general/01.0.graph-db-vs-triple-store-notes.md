# Applications of Property Graphs vs Triple Stores (RDF)

---

## 1. Property Graph Databases - Example Applications

| **Application Area**      | **Example Use Cases**                         | **Why Property Graph?**                        |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Social Networks**       | - Facebook, LinkedIn friend recommendations <br> - Twitter follower analysis | Users (nodes) and relationships (edges) with rich properties (e.g., time of connection, interaction count). |
| **Fraud Detection**       | - Banking transaction network analysis <br> - Insurance claim relationship detection | Easily detect unusual patterns, loops, or multi-hop fraud paths. |
| **Recommendation Engines**| - Amazon product recommendations <br> - Netflix movie recommendations | Connect users to products, tags, ratings; path-based personalized queries. |
| **Knowledge Graphs**      | - Google Knowledge Graph <br> - Corporate Knowledge Bases | Entities with types, relationships, and properties forming complex semantic networks. |
| **IT & Network Operations**| - Network topology discovery <br> - Dependency tracking | Devices, services, and connections modelled as nodes/edges; impact and failure tracing. |
| **Master Data Management (MDM)** | - Single view of customer <br> - Data deduplication | Merge customer profiles across systems via relationship analysis. |
| **Supply Chain & Logistics** | - Route optimization <br> - Supplier network analysis | Model suppliers, shipments, locations as interconnected entities. |
| **Healthcare & Life Sciences** | - Drug discovery <br> - Gene-protein interaction networks | Model biological entities and their complex relationships. |

### Example: Fraud Detection (Banking)
- **Nodes**: Customers, Accounts, Transactions, Merchants  
- **Edges**: `owns`, `transfers`, `pays`, `located_at`  
- **Properties**: Amount, Timestamp, Risk Score  

*Query pattern:* Find cycles or short paths between risky accounts to detect fraud rings.


### E-Commerce Recommendation
- **Nodes**: Users, Products, Categories

- **Edges**: "viewed", "purchased", "belongs_to"

- **Properties**: Price, View Count, Ratings

Query: "Suggest products liked by similar users within 2 hops."
